			<article> <p>I once noticed that nearly every toilet seat is the Bemis brand. I thought this was really weird but who am I? Glad you asked, I'm Nathan Duquette and I love the absurd, while everyone is wandering around being serious and getting mad, I sit back stare at the stucco and notice how the light plays with the texture. When the sun hits the wall at the right angle the face appear. What if this was reincarnation? What if we came back as a fucking stucco wall, its all carbon so why not? Its not like we have a science to define what a soul is or what it can be attached to so why is that a crazy idea?</p>
			<p>I like to think about fractals a lot, rivers look like streams look like arteries look loke the ribs of a leaf. Space is full of orbs circling larger orbs in clusters circling larger clusters. Atoms are orbs circling orbs and we're the clusters and we all circle eachother for infinity right? we die the atoms re assemble into some other shit and then it repeats for a million million years and so on.</p>
			<p>So why so serious? We got tricked into thinking that being serious is somehow superior than the contrast? Or maybe the contrast on the wall at the right light is too much because we know thats where most of us will end up. On the wall of another shitty starbucks that loks like every other starbucks in westlake. Or maybe this is all an absurd idea thats actually just as absurd as all the other ideas about who and what people are.</p>
			<p>I also really like art, hiking, bikes, coffee and beer. My wife and 2.4 kids are pretty cool too.</p>
